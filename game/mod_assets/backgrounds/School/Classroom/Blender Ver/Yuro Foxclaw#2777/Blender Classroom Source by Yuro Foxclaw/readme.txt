"Over there are 3 scenes... The classroom (that includes both the classroom and the corridor)
The space room (still somethings missing stuff like the space HDRI, still havent figured out a good node system to recreate the space\noise from the game)(edited)
And the textures where i created the textures that are not generated directly by nodes
hope you guys enjoy it
I'll update it as i figure more stuff out... also... if you guys don't want to render the floor textures
just put these on the same folder as the .blend and it should work fine"
