all of these backgrounds are copyright minikle but you don't have to credit them in your mod iirc
and I just did color adjusting and some light painting over so i dont need credit either.

@Nuxill so if we're set to use them, we credit a "Royalty Free" website and "Edits by Nuxill from DDMC" correct? :thonking: 

Superb work!

yeah if you need to credit it would be Minikle with edits by Nuxill
