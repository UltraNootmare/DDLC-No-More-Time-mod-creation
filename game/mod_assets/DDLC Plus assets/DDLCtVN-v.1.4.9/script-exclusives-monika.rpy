    mc "I mean, I know you said you like things quieter, but don’t you hang out with huge groups during school hours anyway?"
    m 1g "… That’s a good point." 
    m 2b "The truth is though, I would only \"earn\" my presidency over the other clubs because I’m popular." 
    m 2j "I’d rather ACTUALLY earn it, for a start."
    m 2e "Plus, I still like it quieter anyway. That’s part of the reason it’s a literature club, as not many people will willingly join this."
    "A fair point, seeing as how Sayori had to almost drag me there." 
    mc "I can't understand this though." 
    mc "You became a president with little prerequisites, so over there, you have a lot of power and you barely have to lift a finger." 
    mc "Plus, even as a leader, you wouldn’t need to do NEARLY as much there."
    mc "Isn't that a good thing?"
    "She chuckles."
    m 4a "Were you ever popular [player]?" 
    m "In any grade level?"
    mc "Well… I mean- I was really liked in my class back in 6th grade..." 
    mc "and people were really nice to me last year..." 
    mc "even if it was only so they could cheat off my homework..."
    "Monika again laughs."
    m 1k "No need to impress me, [player]." 
    m 2e "Trust me on this, but popularity is a VERY \"grass is always greener on the other side\" situation."
    mc "But you’re the talk of the entire school!" 
    mc "Everyone thinks you’re really pretty, smart, athletic, and literally everyone wants to date you…"
    m 2f "Does \"everyone\" include you, [player]?"
    "She says this with more of a quizzical tone than an amused one." 
    "As much as I WANT to answer, I decide to ignore the question."
    mc "Why would you NOT want that kind of thing?" 
    m 4e "For one, being watched like that is terrible." 
    m 5a "Have you ever watched the TV show \"Bigger Brother\"?" 
    m "The one with cameras, always and constantly watching?"
    m "Imagine that, every day at school." 
    m "If I was talking to you like this just a few hours earlier, there would already be hundreds of rumors about how you and I are making out in a closet together."
    "I try to hide how much that idea makes me blush." 
    "She continues."
    m 5b "I’m more puzzled at why you'd WANT that?" 
    m "I would think being unpopular is more fun, no?"
    mc "Yea, well, video games, anime, and image boards aren’t all they’re cracked up to be."
    "Monika once again chuckles."
    m 5a "I still wouldn’t mind doing that, honestly." 
    m "Maybe for a day." 
    m 1a "Although I guess the grass is greener for me too, huh?"
    mc "Definitely." 
    mc "Gets kinda lonely when the people who talk to you will only know you for about 10 minutes before you both move on."
    m "I suppose that’s true."
    m 2k "I guess no matter what a person gets, they always look at someone else and wish for what they have, huh?"
    mc "Hey, when it comes to looks at least I think only one of us is wishing we were as attractive as the other."
    m 5a "Aww, don’t sell yourself short, [player]!" 
    m 1k "There are people that will totally find you attractive, inside and out!"
    "She smiles, grabs the materials we were supposed to get in the first place, and walk back."
