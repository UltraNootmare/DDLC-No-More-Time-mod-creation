# DDLC,The Normal VN!
>What is this hip, cool new mod?

Esentially, as the name implies. Each character gets 7 more scenes with you, as well as Monika getting her own route.

>Will it keep the darker tone DDLC has?

Monika's jealousy, Sayori's depression, Natsuki's home life, and Yuri's self harm are all issues present that you can help (or fail to help) deal with.

>Will it keep the element of choice?

Each chapter will include one choice. At the final chapter, your choices will decide your ending.

>After the added chapters, is that all?

The mod is episodic, meaning new chapters will be added semifreqently. Episode 2 is planned sometime before June 31st, 2018.

>Anything else I should know?

This mod is 100% Copyleft; However, make sure if you redistribute, substantial changes are made, and give credit to me as Skull217. Anything and everything can be changed to your desire, if you wish.
